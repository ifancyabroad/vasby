<p class="mb-4">The problem was that whilt the PR agency had throived - their brand had aged somewhat and needed a refresh. The brief was to modernise the brand, so that they could communicate better with various audiences.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Starting from the visual identity we created new color palette guidelines, typography systems, photography guidelines, and graphic elements such as patterns, shapes, and their applications.</p>
<p>We managed to stylize and unify Montieth & Co’s identity into one cohesive brand, that will be used across multiple platforms, such as their website and web application. During the design process, we created components, guidelines, and general templates to easily scale as Montieth’s user base grows with time.</p>
