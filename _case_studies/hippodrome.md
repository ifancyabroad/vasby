<p class="mb-4">Working closely with all at The Hippodrome Casino - we set out to improve the overall design and conversions of their online gaming offering.</p>
<p class="mb-4">We first dug deep in to the UX of the problem at hand. How can the user journey be simplified and condensed. We implemented user research and testing to help us to realise where the pain points were and what could be improved. We then simultaneously looked at the design of the product itself and looked at how we could being this up to date, with new gaming skins, new landing pages and a completely new web application that helped mould the mobile and tablet offering.</p>
<p>The result - a newly redesigned, responsive website and web app that contributed to a  traffic increase of over 6% in the first quarter after launch.</p>
