<p class="mb-4">When Stabb Interiors came to us, their current offering lacked the visual element that their work deserved. They needed to give their current website a facelift that would help to showcase all of the great projects they had worked on and find a way to get prospective clients to see it.</p>
<p class="mb-4">We researched visual layouts and ways of utilising brand elements to bring the new website to life. We worked through various iterations and tested these to see which woked best for users.</p>
<p>The result was a fresh website that focused on the stunning work Stabb had done - helping potential clients see this and increasing conversions.</p>
