<p class="mb-4">When the opportunity came to work with a new HR company that wanted to take on the startup industry, we jumped at the chance.</p>
<p class="mb-4">We started our research and found some very traditional brands within the HR world. There didn’t seem to be too many of the larger companies within the UK and London market that really focused on design. We felt this was a massive gap in the market we could exploit.</p>
<p>We set about creating an electric, vibrant brand identity that would set bonafide apart in the HR market and also sit nicely within a younger tech/startup market. This was then bought together in a fresh modern website to launch the company. The company has now gone on to work with big fashion and tech companies and has had huge success.</p>
