content_title: Creating a legacy brand and product within the travel market.

<p class="mb-4">When a new travel start up approached us to build their brand and offering - we couldn’t have been happier. We set about creating a logo and brand that would be remembered in the busy market.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The idea is that a user can select holiday destinations based on varying factors such as price, weather conditions and distance rather than just location. This led to some real thought in to how the UX would best be suited, and we spent a lot of time researching how the industry big players utilised this. We realised as with any new company - design and set experience was vital in bringing users back to the platform.</p>
<p>Once all of this was thought out we got to building the website and web app that would work across platforms and devices for one complete experience. The result - a newly redesigned, responsive website and web app that would build user loyalty based on its ease of use.</p>
