<p class="mb-4">The problem Brasserie Blanc were having was how they could use their customer database and increase engagement with them - currently struggling to find the right offering.</p>
<p class="mb-4">We strategised at the best offers, promotions and interactivity that would help in this market and increase sales and bookings on the back of it.</p>
<p>The result was a set of email campaigns, landing pages and bespoke offers - utilising our insights research in to their database of customers and with this alone we saw increased interactions by 16% and helped to increase the click through rate by 21% based on the previous 6 campaigns that were sent.</p>
